12/26/2018 2:41:59,Sandeep Saurabh,sandeepsaurabhiitd@gmail.com,+917991180609,Bridgei2i Analytics,Talk,Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Deep Learning (comparing Edward and ZhuSuan python libraries),"While creating model for solution of any real life scenario modelling uncertainty is really important. Traditionally, machine learning provides some approach such as Gaussian Processes for modelling uncertainty but these approaches can’t scale to high dimensional inputs like images and videos. On the other hand deep learning algorithms are great for high dimensional inputs but struggles to model uncertainty.

The solution to the problem described above is the topic of my talk -Bayesian Deep Learning .The talk will be about how probabilistic programming, which has been good in modelling uncertainty and deep neural network, which can scale to high dimensional inputs like images and videos, can be combined into Bayesian Deep Learning which provides a deep learning framework and can also model uncertainty.The talk will cover different types of uncertainties and how to model them with Bayesian approach using python libraries(Edward and ZhuSuan) to create safe A.I.

I’ll utilise the time of my talk as follows:

0-10 mins: Introduction to the problem in hand, of modelling uncertainty and why deep learning is not good enough for the problem. What is traditional probabilistic approach to the problem and it’s shortcomings for high dimensional input, leading to the introduction of Bayesian Deep Learning.

10-20 mins: Explanation of basic mechanism and mathematics behind Bayesian deep learning with some examples.Description of various types of uncertainties such as Epistemic and Aleatoric which need to be modelled.

20-30 mins: Introduction to Edward python library and it’s usefulness for creating Bayesian deep learning frameworks. Some example problems to show the working of this library .

30-40 mins : Introduction to ZhuSuan python library and how it is useful in creating Bayesian deep learning framework along with some examples to show it’s workings

The journey towards becoming a better developer involves in more than just coding. If there is one thing that you want to learn this year to make yourself a better developer, it will be empathy. In this talk we will see, as a developer how to practice empathy and write code empathetically. Also discuss how empathy driven development will make one a better software craftsman and build great teams.


Description: 

The most important skill necessary to build better software, better team and better open source community is not really a technical skill. It has a touch of human element to it, it's empathy. Every developer out there is too focussed on building and running their software in machines and easily fail to realise that they are building software with the help of humans. And for humans.

So, in this python conference, if you are going to learn one thing that will make you a 2x python developer, it is going to be empathy. We will take this time to discuss how empathy plays a major role in software, communities and products. How to deliberately practice empathy and level up ourselves as a better developer and a better human.

""""""When you start to develop your powers of empathy and imagination, the whole world opens up to you.""""""

We hear a lot of buzz with the new fancy asynchronous Python programming using async/await keyword to make our Python code run faster. But really how async works are still not spread well and the majority of Python programmer still not familiar using async/await keyword. In this talks, becasuse Flask is not intended to support async (yet), we are will explore Quart, the Python ASGI web microframework. It is intended to provide the easiest way to use
asyncio functionality in a web context, especially with existing Flask
apps. This is possible as the Quart API is a superset of the Flask API. So you can instantly migrate your Flask app easily!",0:40:00,Intermediate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZjzHjYSnfE,I agree and will abide to the Code of Conduct.,"First, we are will explore the idea behind asynchronous programming and how using asyncio API. In asynchronous Python programming, we have two core things we have to do. We begin using the async method at the front of the function definition and you must await all of the other async calls that you make. Remember it requires Python 3.5 or higher for this feature to use. Second, we are will explore with aiohttp for async web scrapping to see our async program to use in the real world. Finally, we are will turn our predefined Flask app easily into async using Quart. So Quart is a Python web microframework just like Flask it's based on asyncio and it has very good compatibility with Flask. What does that mean? It means has the same API as Flask, it means even the extensions you can install into Flask are compatible with Quart. So if you have a Flask app, chances are you can tweak it a tiny bit, make it a Quart app and then it becomes asyncio enabled. That is our goal, our goal is to take our work in Flask app
that we defined previously and convert it to Quart and that conversion will mean a little bit of stuff to change the framework. ",,,

Modern applications need to handle multiple user requests and do some processing at the same time, and that is a form of concurrency.
Concurrency is important, but it could cause some problems too, such as race conditions and deadlock.
Furthermore, concurrent programming might be hard to test/debug and also might bring performance tradeoff.

For concurrency purposes, Python implement some Standard Libraries such as multiprocessing, threading, and asyncio.
In addition to that CPython (most widely-used implementation of Python language) implements Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) to synchronise the execution of threads.
Having those at our disposal, we can do concurrent programming in Python.

Since it is not scalable to write tests for all possible interactions, we turn to property-based testing - an approach where we *generate* tests instead of *writing* them.

Property-based testing (PBT) is a random-testing approach that first became popular in the Haskell community as QuickCheck. It works by generating random examples to find minimal counterexamples to a pattern or law that ought to always hold true. PBT is especially useful in testing edge cases and interactions between multiple features, particularly in stateful systems.

As web applications are becoming complex its also been a pain doing loadtest especially on angular and reactjs based applications. There are a lot of load testing softwares out there, one of the few applications I’ve used in the past are jmeter, blaze meter, loaderio and of course the apache benchmark, some of these are great but some doesn’t parse pages, gather information like cookies, some can’t efficiently mimic a user purchasing a product online.  Together with my colleagues we both agreed that Elastic Beanstalk + Locust + CasperJS  are the magic ingredients to do a high stake load testing.

While a piece of functionality may work perfectly fine with 5, or even 50, concurrent users, how does it work with 200? 500? 1000 or 10000?

Elastic Beanstalk + Locust + CasperJS = A highly scalable, fairly easy to set up, functional open source load testing framework that meets 95% of our daily needs at Pantheon.
In this talk I will introduce the moving parts and walk through one of our more common load testing scenarios: A non-profit marketing site with an e-commerce based. 

* Attendees should have a good working knowledge of Python, Javascript and Amazon Web Services (EC2). Passing knowledge of Git, Drupal, WordPress, Python, Javascript and Elastic Beanstalk is also useful.

At first I developed an automation toolkit using python and nodejs to automate a report that analyze 100s of portfolio site’s performance by gathering data from different external sources such as new relic, looker and other internal services via API.  Using headless chrome and puppeteer I managed to get screenshots from our looker and New relic in automated passion. This automation tool has reduced the time duration of completing the report from 4-5hrs to 1hr.

Phase 1:
  - Using bash script to consolidate all the tools we used to analyzed a site.
  - Not portable, takes 3hrs to install
  - Maintained only by one person
  - Generates a 60 pages report using google slide document

Phase 2:
  - I managed to dockerized all the components(containers talking with each other via Docker bash )
  - Its now portable, can be installed in 30min
  - My colleagues started to contribute by sending PRs
 - Generates a 60 pages report using google slide document

Phase 3:
  - An on-demand service currently on alpha. Its in auto pilot using kubernetes on GCP
  - no installation needed
  - its a flask based webapp and can handle multiple instances of EBRs
  - all kubernetes pods are talking via Restful API I built using Flask


1. Will talk about an intro of the platform
2. How to dockerized your python application
3. How to make your dockerized app in auto pilot(pods self healing, auto scale based on memory or cpu resources) using Kubernetes
4. How to secure your credentials when deploying your app on kubernetes
5. Demo

Movie forecasting and programming in practice tend to be associated with intuition rather than formal analysis and characterises the tradition of decision making in the film industry. For each week’s movie program, management must determine what movies will be shown, on which screens, on which days, and at what times. The programming problem for an individual movie theatre consists of three interconnected stages:

-Movie selection, i.e., the movies to be shown over the course of a particular week. This includes agreements with movie distributors.
-Forecasting demand of a movie at site, date and time level.
Movie scheduling, given demand of each movie at site, time and date level.
-Attendance prediction in general depends on several factors such as age of the movie, day of the week, time of day, movie type (e.g. kids, romantic, etc.), number of nearby shows of the same movie, screen on which session is scheduled, film format (2D/3D), weather and film genre.

In this talk we will learn about a twisted form of Log-Linear Model using sklearn's ElasticNet linear model and propose a General Attendance Model (GAM) to achieve this objective. This model outperforms both linear regression and neural network models and also creates significant business impact.

GAM can very well be used at any cinema chain across the globe with minor demographic tweaks. Apart from cinema chains GAM can be extended to other parts of entertainment industry, such as demand forecasting of broadway shows, sporting events, music performances and TV shows ",0:25:00,Intermediate,,I agree and will abide to the Code of Conduct.,,,Data Analysis,Forecasting

Due to this, many engineers (not all but many) think or rather believe that they need to have a lot of knowledge before they can even think of building a chatbot of their own or enhancing their product with conversational experiences. 

But, the reality is different. With the help of Applied AI, you can take the top down approach of learning by building these products with the help of AI based frameworks, libraries and services. This talk is about how you can use simple Python programming to quickly build such automations.

This is an intermediate level talk, that’ll help the audience appreciate the Functional Programming Paradigm and how it can be helpful in the day to day scripts that we write. It’ll also touch upon how the concept of functional programming can help elevate the thought process.

What can folks expect?
To learn what the functional programming paradigm is.
To develop the thought process of thinking “functionally.”
How python can be used to write functional code
How day to day work can be made quick and easy
The focus of the talk
What is functional programming? - 10 mins
This segment comprises of exploring what first class objects are and how we’ve been conditioned to think that just variables can be taken as first class objects. Then we move on to explore how even functions can be considered first class objects, and what prime features need be followed to be able to say that functions are first class objects.

What are first class objects? - 5 mins
This segment explains what first class objects actually are and gives a really brief introduction on what makes variables or functions be treated as first class objects. This also include a live coding section, explaining how functions can be:

Assigned to a variable
Passed as a parameter
Returned from another function
How does Python fit in? - 10 mins
This section showcases the different utilities python inherently provides to support functional programming. It explains how map, filter and reduce, fit in and used in our daily habit of writing code.

This also will be accompanied by live code examples and scenarios that we face regularly. We dive a little into partials and look at the tip of the iceberg called decorators.

The Whys and Wherefores of Functional Programming - 5 mins
This is a segment about various real life experiences; situations where functional programming can be the right tool and where this should be a total no, no. Like they say “Right horses for the right courses”, this segment will cover where not to use functional programming and when this debate shouldn’t be brought up. This segment will also cover what is the best place to bring in functional programming and its benefits.

A cache can be easily understood as a saved answer to a question. Caching can speed up an application if a computationally complex question is asked frequently. Instead of the computing the answer over and over, we can use the previously cached answer.

Caching is an important component while scaling applications which are to be used by many users. It solves various problems related to cost and latency. Usually it takes more time to retrieve data from DB rather than cache. Using a cache to avoid recomputing data or accessing a slow database provides us with a great performance boost.

I will describe in depth the different methods of Caching, their pros and cons. This talk will help developers focus on their code before scaling their applications. It will provide immense performance improvements with this simple concept.

Outcomes: The novice audience will be able to understand basic Caching Mechanisms. They will be able to utiilize their knowledge which will serve pivotal while scaling applications

In this talk, I will speak about a simple yet very powerful image manipulation mechanism.

The naive user utilizes the services of any standard toolkit, be it a web service or a remote application for image manipulation. The black box approach to this process is: A user provides an image and other parameters as input to the toolkit which in turn produces the results and returns it back to the user. Often these results are not up to the mark. The image sometimes gets distorted, misaligned or blurred. These standard mechanisms aren't the best way to manipulate images.

Deviating from the standard mechanisms, I would like to talk about a technique called as Content aware image resizing. The primary factor in this technique is the content. It is the content which drives the entire technique. The image is cropped, enlarged or modified keeping in mind the primary factor. For example, we have a painting. It is the responsibility of my cropping algorithm to

I will talk about an algorithm called as Seam Carving which is used under the hood to achieve the aforementioned technique. It is this algorithm and the power of Python libraries, that makes this technique perform better than the standard mechanisms.

But with great powers comes greater responsibility, so the question arises, “Is our AI safe ?”
The critical part of any machine learning system is understanding what it does not know. Unfortunately, today’s deep learning algorithms are usually unable to understand their uncertainty.
This talk will provide an introduction to the re-surging filed of Bayesian Deep Learning. I would be discussing various theoretical aspects and the current state-of-the-art in this domain. I would be taking you through the code for constructing Bayesian deep nets and visualising their uncertainty in their results using libraries like Pytorch,PyMc3.",0:30:00,Intermediate,https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLere47YvK13oeuoK70Q9ry60JLvegd5pT,I agree and will abide to the Code of Conduct.,,,Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence,

Almost all developers spend countless hours configuring, _tweaking_ and micro-managing their **dotfiles** with an obsession to exactly have them like one wants them to be. **I do too**. And everyone has different tastes, which I find fascinating: sit down at a crafty programmer’s shell for a minute and you’ll find that out pretty quick.

[Dotfiles][1] are just configuration files like **.vimrc** and **.gitconfig** on your OS, that stores the settings you have for applications/environments/tools to make life easier while giving you more portability. They are tough to get it right in the first try, and later further maintenance becomes an issue. 

In my talk, majorly we will be discussing how Python help you organize your dotfiles, how it manages it for the time ahead. How setup of dotfiles isn't that complex? **Python** could be the answer to all of your problems. With a tool, one can easily **manage**, **maintain** and **do a lot more** with their dotfiles. 

Make you feel right at _HOME(LY)_ on any system.

## Detailed Description 

 - My talk would start with a basic intro of what **exactly** are Dotfiles? and what is the common way of setting them up? This helps beginners who are new to the topic, get interested and a quick recap of why dotfiles are **important** for all developers.

 - Building up the momentum by **visual queues** and **comparisons** through slides, I would show how exactly Python does the same using *Homely* as Bash does. Later, work through the more intricate details by talking about the features one can implement using Homely and Python highlighting limitations of bash. Like **Automation**, **Logging**, **git control**, **debugging**, **installation of applications** and **so much more**. 

 - **Summing up** by demonstrating a number of scripts that I will be preparing in-advance to showcase the same features that we just talked about. This helps people grasp the talk, the topic, and ""***the why we are doing, what we are doing*** "" part.

 - **Ending the talk**, with a round of questions and showing the setup I use after months of searching through dotfiles repositories to leave them open to all the options they can choose from for setting up their dotfiles and pick the best setup from the knowledge they just gained.
